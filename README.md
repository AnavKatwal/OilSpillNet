### OilSpillNet

This repository contains all the codes and dataset related to the OilSpillNet framework. OilSpillNet is a deep learning framework for automated oil spill segmentation that bridges advances in computer vision, remote sensing and environmental sciences. 

The reposository houses the code base used to train, validate and test the OilSpillNet model, and compare it's performance against popular models like, UNet, Nested Unet, Multi ResUNet and Attention UNet. The code architecture utilizes TensorFlow as a framework and all the models were trained on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
